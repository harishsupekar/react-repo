1. Implement the Sorting functionality for the Rows.
	--> This functionality will be based on the data values associated with the rows and will not delete any record, but will re-order the rows based on the values.

temp0.parentElement.insertBefore(temp1, temp0) --> Moves temp1 before temp0.
 	
Below is the proposed solution for the Compare function:
1. Iterate over each of the table row to get the array as [{rowIndex, valueToSort.}];
2. Sort these object array.
3. Once sorted, then we have to re-arrange the TR elements based on this values, the header values must contain META to compare the elements and should be specific to header values.
